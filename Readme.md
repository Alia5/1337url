# Yet another Go Link shortener

I long wanted a custom link-shortener for [1-3-3-7.dev](https://1-3-3-7.dev) and recently became a professional Go developer (I guess...)  
So here's yet another shitty url shortening service written in Go.

**Notes:**

- Short Strings are 6 random alphanumeric characters, no fancy Base62 encoding stuff  
So this is not really scalable or for public use
  - Enough for my own personal use
- Source URLS must be https, no plain http
  - just to bug you!
- Code is not finished, no tests, no documentation
  - Enough for my own personal use.

You really shouldn't use this.  
It is licensed under WTFPL, however, so feel free!
